After drifting without much direction on the vast sea of the Interweb, I once again find myself on the shore of another unknown website. It looks promising. I shake old pixels and date strings from my clothes as I set off to explore his new site. Is this the one? Have I found a new website to call home? 

We shall have to explore and see.
